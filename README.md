## Previous Instance Form Display Triggering

### Description

Ever see some of these professional applications, perhaps running in the tray that show them selves if the program is executed again yet their is no error generated &amp; wonder how they done it. This is a simple example of one way it can be done. I worked this out for a tray application I am working on . I never seen anything like it posted before so I thought it was slick enough to share.
